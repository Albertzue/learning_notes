### What Is GitOps?
GitOps embodies a set of principles that form the backbone of modern software delivery practices. 
At its core, GitOps hinges on five key aspects, 
each contributing to a streamlined and efficient development and deployment process.
#### Core Elements
1. **Declarative configuration**
First and foremost is the principle of declarative configuration. This implies a departure from the traditional imperative style of issuing specific commands. Instead, GitOps centers around expressing the desired end state of a system, allowing developers to declare intentions rather than prescribe exact actions. 
For instance, specifying the desire for three containers for a given application prompts automated agents to adjust the current state accordingly, potentially terminating existing containers to align with the declared configuration.

2. **Immutable storage**
Git, in the context of GitOps, serves as more than just a version-controlled storage solution; 
it represents immutable storage. While Git is the predominant source control system, the principles of GitOps are adaptable to other version control systems as well. 
The immutability aspect underscores the idea that once a configuration is committed to Git, 
it becomes a static reference point, aiding in reproducibility and traceability. It is also often referred to as the source of truth.

3. **Automation**
Automation is a cornerstone of GitOps, emphasizing the importance of eliminating manual interventions post-commit to the version control system.
 The moment changes are integrated into the VCS, the baton is passed to software agents.

4. **Software agents**
These agents play a pivotal role in executing the necessary actions to realize the newly declared configuration.
The process involves assessing the disparity between the existing system state and the desired state specified in the version control,
encapsulating the essence of GitOps' closed-loop nature.

5. **Closed loop**
Closed loop, in the GitOps paradigm, encapsulates the continuous feedback loop between the actual and desired states of a system.
It signifies that the automated actions taken by software agents are not arbitrary but are a direct response to the evolving configuration stored in the version control.
The closed loop mechanism ensures that the system perpetually converges towards the declared state, fostering consistency and predictability.
