### Priliminary phase
The preliminary phase lays the foundation for the architectural project. 
In this phase, the organizational framework, governance structures and architectural 
principles are defined to ensure that the project is well prepared and structured.

### Phase B Business architecture
In phase B of the ADM, the business architecture is developed.  \
This phase focuses on capturing the company's business processes, organizational 
structures and functions in detail and designing a target architecture that supports the 
business strategy and serves as the basis for the IT architectures.

### Phase C  Information system architecture
 Application architecture: \
 ❖ Identification of the necessary applications and their functions.\
 ❖ Definition of the interfaces and interactions between the applications.\
 ❖ Ensuring the integration of applications into the existing IT infrastructure.
 
 Data architecture:\
 ❖ Modeling of company data, including data flow and storage.\
 ❖ Ensure that the data architecture supports the business requirements.

### Phase D Technology architecture
In Phase D Technology Architecture, the technological infrastructure required to 
support the data and application architectures is developed. 

This phase ensures that the technology components - such as hardware, software and 
networks - are optimally aligned with the requirements of the business and information 
system architectures.

### Possibilities and solution
In phase E Opportunities and solutions, the potential solutions that lead to the 
achievement of the target architecture are identified and evaluated. 

This phase focuses on determining the best strategic options, defining transition 
architectures and determining the necessary steps to implement the target architecture.

### Phase F Migration planning
In phase F Migration planning, a detailed plan is drawn up to manage the implementation 
of the target architecture.  \
This phase focuses on planning the practical implementation of the solutions selected in 
Phase E and ensuring that the transition architectures are implemented effectively and with 
minimal disruption

### Phase G Implementation monitoring
 In phase G Implementation monitoring, the implementation of the architecture in 
practice is monitored and controlled. \
 This phase ensures that the architecture components planned in the previous phases 
are implemented in accordance with the defined specifications and that the 
objectives of the target architecture are achieved
