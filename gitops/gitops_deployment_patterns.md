**"Instance per cluster" (synonym: "standalone")** refers to the use of a GitOps operator with a Kubernetes cluster, see Figure 1. 
This pattern provides strong isolation. On the one hand, this has advantages in terms of security, 
since in the event of a breach, only the applications of the one instance are at risk. On the other hand, 
this approach scales better in terms of load and downtime. The disadvantage is the maintenance effort, 
since several instances have to be operated instead of one central instance. In addition, the resource requirements increase.

This contrasts with the **"hub and spoke" pattern**, see Figure 2,
where a central GitOps operator is used for multiple Kubernetes clusters. Accordingly, 
the advantages and disadvantages are exactly inverted to the instance per cluster pattern: The maintenance effort is lower, but there is a single point of failure,
which scales worse and is less secure.

The **"instance per namespace" pattern (synonym "namespaced")** is similar to "instance per cluster", 
but here one operator is operated per namespace instead of per cluster, see Figure 3.
Using this pattern can be beneficial if a high level of isolation is desired, but the operation of separate Kubernetes clusters is out of the question.
This may occur, for example, due to high on-premises costs or organizational constraints. In principle, this pattern has the same advantages as "instance per cluster". 
It should be noted that the isolation of Kubernetes namespaces is generally lower than for separate clusters.
Also, it should be noted whether operators support subdivision into namespaces at all.
