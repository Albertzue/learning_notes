#### transfer learning
Traditional learning processes build a new model for each new task, based on the available labeled data. This is because traditional machine learning algorithms assume training and test data come from the same feature space, and so if the data distribution changes, or the trained model is applied to a new dataset, users must retrain a newer model from scratch, even if attempting a similar task as the first model (e.g. sentiment analysis classifier of movie reviews versus song reviews). Transfer learning algorithms, however, takes already-trained models or networks as a starting point. It then applies that modelâ€™s knowledge gained in an initial source task or data (e.g. classifying movie reviews) towards a new, yet related, target task or data (e.g. classifying song reviews).
