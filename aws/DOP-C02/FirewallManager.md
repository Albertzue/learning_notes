[AWS Firewall Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/fms-chapter.html)
AWS Firewall Manager simplifies your administration and maintenance tasks across multiple accounts and resources for a variety of protections, 
including AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced, Amazon VPC security groups and network ACLs, AWS Network Firewall, and Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall. 
With Firewall Manager, you set up your protections just once and the service automatically applies them across your accounts and resources, even as you add new accounts and resources.
