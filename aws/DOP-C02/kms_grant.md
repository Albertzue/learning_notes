[Grants in AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html)
---
A grant is a policy instrument that allows AWS principals to use KMS keys in cryptographic operations. 
It also can let them view a KMS key (DescribeKey) and create and manage grants. When authorizing access to a KMS key, grants are considered along with key policies and IAM policies. 
Grants are often used for temporary permissions because you can create one, use its permissions, and delete it without changing your key policies or IAM policies.
