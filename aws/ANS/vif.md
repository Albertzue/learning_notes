With these connections, you can create virtual interfaces directly to public AWS services (for example, to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon Connect) or to Amazon VPC, bypassing internet service providers in your network path. An AWS Direct Connect point-of-presence (AWS DX POP), carrier interconnection, and data center interconnection provides access to AWS in the Region with which it is associated. You can use a single connection in an AWS Region or AWS GovCloud (US) to access public AWS services in all other Regions.

Create a virtual interface to enable access to AWS services. A public virtual interface (public VIF) enables access to public services such as Amazon S3 or Amazon Connect. A private virtual interface (private VIF) enables access to your VPC and hosted workloads. A transit virtual interface (transit VIF) is used to access one or more Amazon Transit Gateways associated with Direct Connect gateways.
