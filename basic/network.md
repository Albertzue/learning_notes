# Network bridge
A network bridge is a computer networking device that creates a single, aggregate network from multiple communication networks or network segments.Bridging is distinct from routing. Routing allows multiple networks to communicate independently and yet remain separate, whereas bridging connects two separate networks as if they were a single network.
