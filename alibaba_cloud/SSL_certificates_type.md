Domain Validated (DV)

Organization Validated (OV)

and Extended Validation (EV)



## Decoding TLS Acronyms
The names of each SSL certificate type represent the validation steps that took place before issuance of the certificate. For example, 
Domain Validated certificates refer to the simple verification of the owner of a URL, 
whereas Organization Validated certificates verify the domain owner and authenticate the business organization affiliated with the URL. 
Extended Validation certificates are high assurance identity certificates because they require verification of the domain owner, business organization and the legal entity of the business involved
