#### Chapter 1
1. To make all that work, the network hardware in your computer—an integrated network interface card (NIC)— implements some physical layer standards to support physical communications. That NIC also supports the related data-link standards. The OS on the computer implements protocols from the network and transport layers. Finally, that web browser implements some application layer protocols (for instance, HTTP or HTTPS.)

#### Chapter 2 
1. The term **Ethernet** refers to a family of LAN standards that together define the physical and data-link layers of the world’s most popular wired LAN technology
2. Devices using **unshielded twisted-pair (UTP)** cabling transmit data over electrical circuits via the copper
wires inside the cable.
3. The IEEE also uses more meaningful shortcut names that identify the speed, as well as a clue about whether
the cabling is UTP (with a suffix that includes T) or fiber (with a suffix that includes X).

4. what is an Ethernet LAN? It is a combination of user devices, LAN switches, and different kinds of cabling. Each link can use different types of cables, at different speeds. However, they all work together to deliver Ethernet frames from the one device on the LAN to some other device.

6. When electrical current passes over any wire, it creates electromagnetic interference (EMI) that interferes with the electrical signals in nearby wires, including the wires in the same cable. (EMI between wire pairs in the same cable is called crosstalk.) Twisting the wire pairs together helps cancel out most of the EMI, so most networking physical links that use copper wires use twisted pairs.
