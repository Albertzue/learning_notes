**Term frequency (tf)** is a measure of how often a particular term appears in a matching
document, and it’s an indication of how “well” a document matches the term

**Inverse document frequency (idf)** a measure of how “rare” a search term is, is calculated by finding the document frequency (how many total documents the search
term appears within), and calculating its inverse

**Precision** measures how correct each of the results being returned is, **Recall** is a measure of how thorough the search results are

**A denormalized document** is one in which all fields are self-contained within the document, even if
the values in those fields are duplicated across many documents.
