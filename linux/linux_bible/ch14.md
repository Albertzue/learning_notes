```
The ip addr show output displays information about your network interfaces, in this case from a laptop running Fedora 30.
The lo entry in the first line of the output shows the loopback interface, 
which is used to allow network commands run on the local system to connect to the local system. The IP address for localhost is 127.0.0.1/8 (the /8 is CIDR notation, indicating that 127.0 is the network number and 0.1 is the host number). 
Add a -s option (ip -s addr show) to see statistics of packet transmissions and errors associated with each interface.

In this case, the wired Ethernet interface (enp4s0) is down (no cable), but the wireless interface is up (wlp2s0). 
The MAC address on the wireless interface (wlp2s0) is e0:06:e6:83:ac:c7 and the Internet (IPv4) address is 192.168.1.83. An IPv6 address is also enabled.



Another popular command for seeing network interface information is the ifconfig command. By default, ifconfig shows similar information to that of ip addr, but ifconfig also shows the number of packets received (RX) and transmitted (TX) by default, as well as the amount of data and any errors or dropped packets:
```
# ifconfig wlp2s0
wlp2s0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.1.83 netmask 255.255.255.0
             broadcast 192.168.1.255
        inet6 2600:1700:722:a10:b55a:fca6:790d:6aa6
             prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x0<global>
        inet6 fe80::25ff:8129:751b:23e3
             prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x20<link>
        inet6 2600:1700:722:a10::489
             prefixlen 128 scopeid 0x0<global>
        ether e0:06:e6:83:ac:c7 txqueuelen 1000 (Ethernet)
        RX packets 208402 bytes 250962570 (239.3 MiB)
        RX errors 0 dropped 4 overruns 0 frame 0
        TX packets 113589 bytes 13240384 (12.6 MiB)
        TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0
```
Checking connectivity to remote systems
---
To make sure that you can reach systems that are available on the network, you can use the ping command. As long as the computer responds to ping requests (not all do), you can use ping to send packets to that system in a way that asks them to respond. Here is an example:
```
$ ping host1
PING host1 (192.168.1.15 ) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from host1 (192.168.1.15 ): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.062 ms
64 bytes from host1 (192.168.1.15 ): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.044 ms
^C
--- host1 ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 1822ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.044/0.053/0.062/0.009 ms
The ping command shown here continuously pings the host named host1. After a few pings, press Ctrl+C to end the pings, and the last few lines show you how many of the ping requests succeeded.
```
You could have used the IP address (192.168.1.15, in this case) to see that you could reach the system. However, 
using the hostname gives you the additional advantage of knowing that your name-to-IP-address translation (being done by your DNS server or local hosts file) is working properly as well. 
In this case, however, host1 appeared in the local /etc/hosts file.


Checking routing information
---
Routing is the next thing that you can check with respect to your network interfaces. The following snippets show you how to use the ip and route commands to do that:

```
# ip route show
default via 192.168.122.1 dev ens3 proto dhcp metric 20100 
192.168.122.0/24 dev ens3 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.122.194 metric 
```

The ip route show command example illustrates that the 192.168.122.1 address provides the route to the host from a RHEL 8 VM over the ens3 network interface.
Communications to any address in the 192.168.122.0/24 range from the VM (192.168.122.194) goes over that interface. The route command can provide similar information:
```
# route
Kernel IP routing table
Destination   Gateway    Genmask       Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
default       homeportal 0.0.0.0       UG    600    0     0 wlp2s0
192.168.1.0   0.0.0.0    255.255.255.0 U     600    0     0 wlp2s0
192.168.122.0 0.0.0.0    255.255.255.0 U     0      0     0 virbr0
```

Viewing the host and domain names
---

To see the hostname assigned to the local system, type hostname. To just see the domain portion of that name, use the dnsdomainname command:
```
# hostname
spike.example.com
# dnsdomainname
example.com
```
