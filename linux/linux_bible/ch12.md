Understanding partition tables
---

PC architecture computers have traditionally used Master Boot Record (MBR) partition tables 
to store information about the sizes and layouts of the hard disk partitions. 

Many Linux partitioning tools have been updated to handle GUID partition tables (gpt). 
Other tools for handling GUID partition tables have been added. 
Because the popular fdisk command does not support gpt partitions,
the parted command is used to illustrate partitioning in this chapter.

In particular, MBR partitions are limited to 2TB in size. 
GUID partitions can create partitions up to 9.4ZB (zettabytes)

Viewing disk partitions
---

To view disk partitions, use the parted command with the ‐l option. 
The following is an example of partitioning on a 160GB fixed hard drive on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 system:
```
# parted -l /dev/sda
Disk /dev/sda: 160.0 GB, 160000000000 bytes, 312500000 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk label type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x0008870c
   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1   *        2048     1026047      512000   83  Linux
/dev/sda2         1026048   304281599   151627776   8e  Linux LVM
```

For x86 computers, disks can have up to four primary partitions.
So, to have more than four total partitions, one must be an extended partition.
Any partitions beyond the four primary partitions are logical partitions that use space from the extended partition.

Creating a single‐partition disk
---

1. Install the new hard drive or insert the new USB flash drive.
2. Partition the new disk.
3. Create the filesystems on the new disk.
4. Mount the filesystems.

Creating a multiple‐partition disk
---
I started this procedure by overwriting the USB drive with the dd command (dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sd<number> bs=1M count=100).
This allowed me to start with a fresh master boot record. 
Please be careful to use the right drive number, or you could erase your operating system!


The default partition type is Linux. 
I decided that I wanted to use some of the partitions for swap space (type 82), FAT32 (type x), 
and Linux LVM (type 8e). To do that, I type t and indicate which partition type to use. 
Type L to see a list of partition types.
```
        Command (m for help): t
        Partition number (1-6): 2
        Hex code (type L to list codes): 82
        Changed type of partition 'Linux' to 'Linux swap / Solaris'.

        Command (m for help): t
        Partition number (1-6): 5
        Hex code (type L to list codes): c
        Changed type of partition 'Linux' to 'W95 FAT32 (LBA)'.

        Command (m for help): t
        Partition number (1-6): 6
        Hex code (type L to list codes): 8e
        Changed type of partition 'Linux' to 'Linux LVM'.
```
Using Logical Volume Manager Partitions
---

Logical Volume Manager (LVM) offers lots of flexibility and efficiency in dealing with constantly changing storage needs. With LVM, physical disk partitions are added to pools of space called volume groups. Logical volumes are assigned space from volume groups as needed. This gives you these abilities:

1. Add more space to a logical volume from the volume group while the volume is still in use.
2. Add more physical volumes to a volume group if the volume group begins to run out of space. The physical volumes can be from disks.
3. Move data from one physical volume to another so you can remove smaller disks and replace them with larger ones while the filesystems are still in use—again, without downtime.

With LVM, it is also easier to shrink filesystems to reclaim disk space, 
although shrinking does require that you unmount the logical volume (but no reboot is needed). 
LVM also supports advanced features, such as mirroring and working in clusters.

I use the pvdisplay command to see if that partition is being used in an LVM group:
```
# pvdisplay /dev/sda2
  --- Physical volume ---
  PV Name               /dev/sda2
  VG Name               vg_abc
  PV Size               148.52 GiB / not usable 2.00 MiB
  Allocatable           yes (but full)
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
  Total PE              38021
  Free PE               0
  Allocated PE          38021
  PV UUID               wlvuIv-UiI2-pNND-f39j-oH0X-9too-AOII7R
```
```
otice that LVM tools show disk space in MiB and GiB. One MB is 1,000,000 bytes (10∧6), 
while a MiB is 1,048,576 bytes (2∧20). A MiB is a more accurate way to reflect how data are stored on a computer. 
But marketing people tend to use MB because it makes the hard disks, CDs,
and DVDs they sell look like they have more capacity than they do. 
Keep in mind that most tools in Linux display storage data in MiB and GiB,
although some can display MB and GB as well.
```
```
# vgdisplay vg_abc
  --- Volume group ---
  VG Name               vg_abc

```
Expand the logical volume using the lvextend command:
---

1. Note how much space is currently on the logical volume, and then check that space is available in the logical volume's volume group:
```
        # vgdisplay myvg0
        …
          VG Size               <4.00 MiB
          PE Size               4.00 MiB
          Total PE              1023
          Alloc PE / Size       256 / 1.00 GiB
          Free  PE / Size       767 / <3.00 GiB
        # df -h /mnt/mymusic/
        Filesystem                 Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
        /dev/mapper/myvg0-music    976M  2.6M  987M   1% /mnt/mymusic
```
2. Expand the logical volume using the lvextend command:
```
 # lvextend -L +1G /dev/mapper/myvg0-music
Size of logical volume myvg0/music changed 
 from 1.00GiB to 2.00 GiB (512 extents).
 Logical volume myvg0/music successfully resized
```
3. Resize the filesystem to fit the new logical volume size:
```
 # resize2fs -p /dev/mapper/myvg0-music
```
5. Check to see that the filesystem is now resized to include the additional disk space:
```
# df -h /mnt/mymusic/
Filesystem               Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/myvg0-music  2.0G  3.0M  1.9G   1% /mnt/mymusic
```
Mounting Filesystems
---
When you boot Linux,
usually all of the Linux partitions on your hard disk are listed in your /etc/fstab file and are mounted. 

Supported filesystems
---

To see filesystem types that are currently loaded in your kernel, type cat /proc/filesystems.
The list that follows shows a sample of filesystem types that are currently supported in Linux,
although they may not be in use at the moment or even available on the Linux distribution you are using.

Enabling swap areas
---
A swap area is an area of the disk that is made available to Linux if the system runs out of memory (RAM). 
If your RAM is full and you try to start another application without a swap area, that application will fail.

With a swap area, Linux can temporarily swap out data from RAM to the swap area and then get it back when needed. 
You take a performance hit, but it is better than having processes fail.

To create a swap area from a partition or a file, use the mkswap command. 
To enable that swap area temporarily, you can use the swapon command. 
For example, here's how to check your available swap space, create a swap file, 
enable the swap file, and then check that the space is available on your system:
```
# free -m
         total    used     free    shared  buffers  cached
Mem:      1955     663     1291         0       42     283
-/+ buffers/cache:          337      1617
Swap:      819       0      819
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/tmp/myswap bs=1M count=1024
# mkswap /var/opt/myswap
# swapon /var/opt/myswap
# free -m
         total    used     free  shared  buffers     cached
Mem:      1955    1720      235       0       42       1310
-/+ buffers/cache:          367    1588
Swap:     1843       0     1843
```

The free command shows the amount of swap before and after creating, making, 
and enabling the swap area with the swapon command. 
That amount of swap is available immediately and temporarily to your system.
To make that swap area permanent, you need to add it to your /etc/fstab file. Here is an example:
```
/var/opt/myswap  swap   swap    defaults   0 0
```

To test that the swap file works before rebooting, 
you can enable it immediately (swapon ‐a) and check that the additional swap area appears:
```
# swapon -a
```
Disabling swap area
---

First, make sure that no space is being used on the swap device (using the free command), 
and then use swapoff to turn off the swap area so that you can reuse the space. Here is an example:
```
# free -m
         total    used     free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:      1955    1720      235          0         42       1310
-/+ buffers/cache: 367     1588
Swap:     1843       0     1843
# swapoff /var/opt/myswap
# free -m
Mem:      1955    1720      235          0         42       1310
-/+ buffers/cache: 367     1588
Swap:      819       0      819
```
Using the fstab file to define mountable file systems
---
In general, the first column of /etc/fstab shows the device or share (what is mounted),
while the second column shows the mount point (where it is mounted).
That is followed by the type of filesystem, any mount options (or defaults), 
and two numbers (used to tell commands such as dump and fsck what to do with the filesystem).

To see all of the UUIDs assigned to storage devices on your system, type the blkid command, as follows:
```
# blkid
/dev/sda1:
  UUID="78bdae46-9389-438d-bfee-06dd934fae28" TYPE="ext4"
/dev/sda2:
  UUID="wlvuIv-UiI2-pNND-f39j-oH0X-9too-AOII7R" TYPE="LVM2_member"
/dev/mapper/vg_abc-lv_root:
  UUID="3e6f49a6-8fec-45e1-90a9-38431284b689" TYPE="ext4"
/dev/mapper/vg_abc-lv_swap:
  UUID="77662950-2cc2-4bd9-a860-34669535619d" TYPE="swap"
/dev/mapper/vg_abc-lv_home:
  UUID="7ffbcff3-36b9-4cbb-871d-091efb179790" TYPE="ext4"
/dev/sdb1:
  SEC_TYPE="msdos" UUID="75E0-96AA" TYPE="vfat"
```

**Field 5:** The number in this field indicates whether the filesystem needs to be dumped (that is, have its data backed up). 
A 1 means that the filesystem needs to be dumped, and a 0 means that it doesn't. 
(This field is no longer particularly useful because most Linux administrators use more sophisticated backup options than the dump command. Most often, a 0 is used.)

**Field 6:** The number in this field indicates whether the indicated filesystem should be checked with fsck when the time comes for it to be checked: 1 means it needs to be checked first, 
2 means to check after all those indicated by 1 have already been checked, and 0 means don't check it.

Mounting a disk image in loopback
---
```
# mkdir /mnt/mydvdimage
# mount -o loop whatever-i686-disc1.iso /mnt/mydvdimage
```
In this example, the /mnt/mydvdimage directory is created,
and then the disk image file (whatever‐i686‐disc1.iso) residing in the current directory is mounted on it. 
You can now cd to that directory, view the contents of it, 
and copy or use any of its contents.
This is useful for downloaded DVD images from which you want to install software without having to burn the image to DVD.
You could also share that mount point over NFS,
so you could install the software from another computer. When you are finished, to unmount the image, 
type umount /mnt/mydvdimage.
