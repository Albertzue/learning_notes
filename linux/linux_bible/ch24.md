# Understanding SELinux Benefits

SELinux is a security enhancement module deployed on top of Linux. It provides additional security measures, is included by default, and is set to be in enforcing mode in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Fedora.

SELinux provides improved security on the Linux system via role based access controls (RBACs) on subjects and objects (aka processes and resources). “Traditional” Linux security uses Discretionary Access Controls (DACs).

 With RBAC, a process only has access to resources that it is explicitly allowed to access, based on the assigned role. The way that SELinux implements RBAC is to assign an SELinux policy to a process. That policy restricts access as follows:
- Only letting the process access resources that carry explicit labels
- Making potentially insecure features, such as write access to a directory, available as Booleans, which can be turned on or off

SELinux is not a replacement for DAC. Instead, it is an additional security layer.
- DAC rules are still used when using SELinux.
- DAC rules are checked first, and if access is allowed, then SELinux policies are checked.
- If DAC rules deny access, SELinux policies are not reviewed.
```
SELinux is the default security enhancement of Red Hat distributions, whereas AppArmor is the default security enhancement for Ubuntu. You can still install SELinux on Ubuntu by using the command sudo apt-get install selinux and then reboot. 
However, as of this writing, the Ubuntu Wiki page for SELinux suggests that you do not use Ubuntu's SELinux package (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SELinux). If you want to learn more about AppArmor, go to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AppArmor.
```

# Understanding How SELinux Works


The example that follows includes ls -lZ and the same file, my_stuff, but instead of just the DAC controls, the -Z option displays the SELinux security RBAC controls too.
```
$ ls -lZ my_stuff
-rw-rw-r--. johndoe johndoe unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 … my_stuff
```
The ls -Z example displays four items associated with the file that are specific to SELinux:

- user (unconfined_u)
- role (object_r)
- type (user_home_t)
- level (s0)

These four RBAC items (user, role, type, and level) are used in the SELinux access control to determine appropriate access levels. Together, the items are called the SELinux security context. A security context (ID badge) is sometimes called a security label.


These security context assignments are given to subjects (processes and users). Each security context has a specific name. The name given depends upon what object or subject it has been assigned: Files have a file context, users have a user context, and processes have a process context, also called a domain.

#### Implementing SELinux security models

The role-based access control model, type enforcement, Multi-Level Security, and Bell-LaPadula models are all interesting topics. SELinux implements these models through a combination of four primary SELinux pieces:

- Operational modes
- Security contexts
- Policy types
- Policy rule packages

#### Understanding SELinux operational modes
SELinux comes with three operational modes: disabled, permissive, and enforcing. Each of these modes offers different benefits for Linux system security.

##### Using the disabled mode
In the disabled mode, SELinux is turned off. The default method of access control, Discretionary Access Control (DAC), is used instead. This mode is useful for circumstances in which enhanced security is not required.
```
TIP
If all you care about is turning SELinux off, you have found the answer. Just edit the configuration file /etc/selinux/config and change the text SELINUX= to SELINUX=disabled. SELinux will be disabled after a system reboot. 
```

##### Using the permissive mode
In permissive mode, SELinux is turned on, but the security policy rules are not enforced. When a security policy rule should deny admission, access is still allowed. However, a message is sent to a log file denoting that access should have been denied.

In some cases, you can use the audit2allow command to read the SELinux audit logs and generate new SELinux rules to allow the denied actions selectively. This can be a quick way to get your applications working on your Linux system without disabling SELinux.

##### Using the Enforcing mode
The name says it all. In enforcing mode, SELinux is turned on and all of the security policy rules are enforced.

#### Understanding SELinux security contexts
As mentioned earlier, an SELinux security context is the method used to classify objects (such as files) and subjects (such as users and programs). The defined security context allows SELinux to enforce policy rules for subjects accessing objects. A security context consists of four attributes: user, role, type, and level.

- `User` The user attribute is a mapping of a Linux username to an SELinux name. This is not the same as a user's login name, and it is referred to specifically as the SELinux user. The SELinux username ends with a u, making it easier to identify in the output. Regular unconfined users have an unconfined_u user attribute in the default targeted policy.
- `Role` A designated role in the company is mapped to an SELinux role name. The role attribute is then assigned to various subjects and objects. Each role is granted access to other subjects and objects based on the role's security clearance and the object's classification level. More specifically, for SELinux, users are assigned a role and roles are authorized for particular types or domains. Using roles can force accounts, such as root, into a less privileged position. The SELinux role name has an r at the end. On a targeted SELinux system, processes run by the root user have a system_r role, while regular users run under the unconfined_r role.
- `Type` This type attribute defines a domain type for processes, a user type for users, and a file type for files. This attribute is also called security type. Most policy rules are concerned with the security type of a process and what files, ports, devices, and other elements of the system that process has access to (based on their security types). The SELinux type name ends with a t.
- Level The level is an attribute of Multi-Level Security (MLS), and it enforces the Bell-LaPadula model. It is optional in TE but is required if you are using MLS.

#### Users have security contexts

To see your SELinux user context, enter the id command at the shell prompt. The following is an example of the security context for user johndoe:
```
$ id
uid=1000(johndoe) gid=1000(johndoe) groups=1000(johndoe)
 context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
```
The user's security context list shows the following:

- user: The Linux user, johndoe, is mapped to the SELinux unconfined_u user.
- role: The SELinux user, unconfined_u, is mapped to the role of the unconfined_r.
- type: The user has been given the type of unconfined_t.
- level:
 - sensitivity: The user has only one sensitivity level, and it is the lowest level of s0.
 - categories: The user has access to c0.c1023, which is all categories (c0 through to c1023).

#### Files have security contexts
A file also has a security context. To see an individual file's context, use the -Z option on the ls command. The following is a security context for the file my_stuff:
```
$ ls -Z my_stuff
-rw-rw-r--. johndoe johndoe
 unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 my_stuff
```

The file context list shows the following:

- user: The file is mapped to the SELinux unconfined_u user.
- role: The file is mapped to the role of object_r.
- type: The file is considered to be part of the user_home_t domain.
- level:
  - sensitivity: The user has only one sensitivity level, and it is the lowest level of s0.
  - categories: MCS is not set for this file.

#### Processes have security contexts
```
# ps -eZ | grep bash
unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 1589 pts/0 00:00:00 bash
unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 5289 pts/1 00:00:00 bash
unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 5350 pts/1 00:00:00 bash
```

#### Understanding SELinux Policy types
SELinux has different policies among which you can choose:
- Targeted
- MLS
- Minimum
Each policy implements different access controls to match your organization's needs. It is critical to understand these policy types in order to select the correct one for your particular security requirements.
##### Targeted policy

The Targeted policy's primary purpose is to restrict “targeted” daemons. However, it can also restrict other processes and users. Targeted daemons are sandboxed. A sandbox is an environment where programs can run but their access to other objects is tightly controlled.

A process running in such an environment is said to be “sandboxed.” Thus, a targeted daemon is restricted so that no malicious attacks launched through them can affect other services or the Linux system as a whole. Targeted daemons make it safer for you to share your print server, file server, web server, or other services while limiting the risks that access to those services pose to other assets on your system.

All subjects and objects not targeted are run in the unconfined_t domain. The unconfined_t domain has no SELinux policy restrictions and thus only uses the “traditional” Linux security.

SELinux comes with the Targeted policy set as the default. Thus, by default, SELinux targets only a few daemons.


##### MLS (Multi-Level Security) policy
The MLS policy's primary purpose is to enforce the Bell-LaPadula model. It grants access to other subjects and objects based upon a role's security clearance and the object's classification level.

In the MLS policy, a security context's MLS attribute is critical. Otherwise, the policy rules will not know how to enforce access restrictions.

Minimum policy
This policy is just as it sounds—minimal. It was originally created for low-memory machines or devices such as smartphones.

##### Minimum policy
The Minimum policy is essentially the same as the Targeted policy, but only the base policy rule package is used. This “bare-bones” policy can be used to test out the effects of SELinux on a single designated daemon. For low-memory devices, the Minimum policy allows SELinux to run without consuming a great deal of resources.

#### Understanding SELinux policy rule packages

Policy rules, also called allow rules, are the rules used by SELinux to determine if a subject has access to an object. Policy rules are installed with SELinux and are grouped into packages, also called modules.

 To view this documentation on Fedora or RHEL, open your system's browser and type in the following URL: file:///usr/share/doc/selinux-policy/html/index.html. For Ubuntu, the URL is file:///usr/share/doc/selinux-policy-doc/html/index.html. If you do not have the policy documentation on your system, you can install it on a Fedora or RHEL system by typing yum install selinux-policy-doc at the command line. On Ubuntu, type sudo apt-get install selinux-policy-doc at the command line.

 # Configuring SELinux
 SELinux comes preconfigured. You can use the SELinux features without any configuration work. However, rarely do the preconfigured settings meet all of your Linux system's security needs.

SELinux configurations can only be set and modified by the root user. Configuration and policy files are located in the /etc/selinux directory. The primary configuration file is the /etc/selinux/config file, and it appears as follows:
```
# cat /etc/selinux/config
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#      enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#      permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#      disabled - SELinux is fully disabled.
SELINUX=enforcing
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these three values:
#     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
#     minimum - Modification of targeted policy.
#               Only selected processes are protected. 
#     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
SELINUXTYPE=targeted
```
This main SELinux configuration file allows you to set the mode and the policy type.

#### Setting the SELinux mode
To see SELinux's current mode on your system, use the getenforce command. To see both the current mode and the mode set in the configuration file, use the sestatus command. Both commands are shown in the code that follows:
```
# getenforce
Enforcing
# sestatus
SELinux status:                 enabled
SELinuxfs mount:                /sys/fs/selinux
SELinux root directory:         /etc/selinux
Loaded policy name:             targeted
Current mode:                   enforcing
Mode from config file:          enforcing
Policy MLS status:              enabled
Policy deny_unknown status:     allowed
Memory protection checking:     actual (secure)
Max kernel policy version:      31
```

To change the mode setting, you can use the setenforce newsetting, where newsetting is either

- enforcing or 1
- permissive or 0


When switching from disabled to either enforcing or permissive mode, SELinux automatically relabels the filesystem after a reboot. This means that SELinux checks and changes the security contexts of any files with incorrect security contexts (for example, mislabeled files) that can cause problems in the new mode. Also, any files not labeled are labeled with contexts. This relabeling process can take a long time because each file's context is checked. Following is the message that you'll receive when a system is going through a relabeling process after a reboot:
```
*** Warning -- SELinux targeted policy relabel is required.
*** Relabeling could take a very long time, depending on file
*** system size and speed of hard drives.
To modify the mode in the /etc/selinux/config file, change the line SELINUX= to one of the following:
```
- SELINUX=disabled
- SELINUX=enforcing
- SELINUX=permissive

The SELinux configuration file example that follows shows that the mode has been set to permissive. Now, when a system reboot occurs, the mode is changed.
```
# cat /etc/selinux/config
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
#     minimum - Modification of targeted policy.
#               Only selected processes are protected. 
#     mls - Multi Level Security protection
SELINUX=permissive
…
```
The primary SELinux configuration file does not just contain the mode setting. It also specifies the policy type, which will be enforced.

#### Setting the SELinux policy type

If you set the SELinux type to mls or minimum, you need to make sure that you have their policy package installed first. Check by typing the following command:
```
yum list selinux-policy-mls or yum list selinux-policy-minimum
```
```
NOTE
To check the SELinux policy packages on Ubuntu, use the command sudo apt-cache policy package_name.
```

The example of the SELinux configuration file that follows shows that the type has been set to mls. Now when a system reboot occurs, the policy type is changed.
```
# cat /etc/selinux/config
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
…
# SELINUXTYPE= type of policy in use. Possible values are:
 
#     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
#     minimum - Modification of targeted policy.
#               Only selected processes are protected. 
#     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
SELINUXTYPE=mls
```

#### Managing SELinux security contexts

SELinux security contexts allow SELinux to enforce policy rules for subjects accessing objects. Your Linux system comes with security contexts already assigned.

To view current SELinux file and process security contexts, use the secon command. Table 24.1 lists available options on the secon command.


|Option|	Description|
|------|------------|
|-u	|Use this option to show the user of the security context.|
|-r |	Use this option to show the role of the security context.|
|-t	|Use this option to show the type of the security context.|
|-s	|Use this option to show the sensitivity level of the security context.|
|-c |	Use this option to show the clearance level of the security context.|
-m	Use this option to show the sensitivity and clearance level of the security context as an MLS range.


If you use the secon command with no designation, it shows you the current process's security context. To see another process's security context, use the -p option. The example that follows shows you how to use secon to view the current and the systemd process's security context.
```
# secon -urt
user: unconfined_u
role: unconfined_r
type: unconfined_t
# secon -urt -p 1
user: system_u
role: system_r
type: init_t
```
To view a file's security context, you use the -f option, as shown here:
```
# secon -urt -f /etc/passwd
user: system_u
role: object_r
type: passwd_file_t
```

The secon command doesn't show your security context. To see your security context, use the id command.

##### Managing the user security context

Remember that every system user login ID is mapped to a particular SELinux user ID. To see a mapping list on your system, enter the semanage login -l command. The semanage command and its output are shown in the code that follows. If a user login ID is not listed, then it uses the “default” login mapping, which is the Login Name of _default_. Notice that the associated MLS/MCS settings for each SELinux user are shown as well.
```
# semanage login -l
Login Name           SELinux User         MLS/MCS Range     Service
__default__          unconfined_u         s0-s0:c0.c1023    *
root                 unconfined_u         s0-s0:c0.c1023    *
```

To see a current display of the SELinux users and their associated roles, use the command semanage user -l. The partial display that follows shows roles mapped to SELinux usernames:
```
# semanage user -l
 
             Labeling MLS/      MLS/
SELinux User Prefix   MCS Level MCS Range       SELinux Roles
guest_u      user     s0        s0              guest_r
…
user_u       user     s0        s0              user_r
xguest_u     user     s0        s0              xguest_r
```

If you need to add a new SELinux username, the semanage utility is used again. This time, the command is semanage user -a selinux_username. To map a login ID to the newly-added SELinux username, the command is semanage login -a -s selinux_username loginID. The semanage utility is a powerful tool in managing your SELinux configuration. For more information on the semanage utility, see the man pages.

#### Managing the file security context
Labeling files is critical to maintaining proper access control to each file's data. SELinux does set file security labels upon installation and upon system reboot when the SELinux mode is switched from disabled. To see a file's current label (aka security context), use the ls -Z command, as shown here:
```
# ls -Z /etc/passwd
-rw-r--r--. root root system_u:object_r:etc_t:s0 /etc/passwd
```

The chcat and chcon commands, allow you to change a file's security context. In the following example, the chcon command is used to change the SELinux user associated with file.txt from undefined_u to system_u.
```
# ls -Z file.txt
-rw-rw-r--. johndoe johndoe
 unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 file.txt
# chcon -u system_u file.txt
# ls -Z file.txt
-rw-rw-r--. johndoe johndoe
 system_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 file.txt
```

# Managing SELinux policy rule packages

Policy rules are the rules used by SELinux to determine whether a subject has access to an object. They are grouped into packages, also called modules, and are installed with SELinux. An easy way to view the modules on your system is to use the semodule -l command. It lists all of the policy modules along with their current version number. An example of the semodule -l command is shown here:
```
# semodule -l
abrt
accountsd
acct
…
xserver
zabbix
zarafa
zebra
zoneminder
zosremote
```

# Monitoring and Troubleshooting SELinux
#### Understanding SELinux logging

SELinux uses a cache called the Access Vector Cache (AVC) when reviewing policy rules for particular security contexts. When access is denied, called an AVC denial, a denial message is put into a log file.

These logged denial messages can help you diagnose and address routine SELinux policy violations. Where these denial messages are logged depends upon the status of the auditd and rsyslogd daemons:

- If the auditd daemon is running, the denial messages are logged to /var/log/audit/audit.log.
- If auditd is not running, but the rsyslogd daemon is running, the denial messages are logged to /var/log/messages.
