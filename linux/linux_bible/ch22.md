# Limiting access to the root user account
- All sudo use (who, what, when) is recorded in /var/log/secure, including any failed sudo access attempts. Recent Linux systems store all sudo access in the systemd journal (type journalctl -f to watch live sudo access attempts, along with other system messages).
- After you grant someone sudo permission, you can try to restrict root access to certain commands in the /etc/sudoers file (with the visudo command). However, after you grant root permission to a user, even in a limited way, it is difficult to be sure that a determined user can't find ways to gain full root access to your system and do what they want to it.

To set a user account with an expiration date, use the usermod command. The format is usermod -e yyyy-mm-dd user_name. In the following code, the account tim has been set to expire on January 1, 2021.
```
# usermod -e 2021-01-01 tim
```
To verify that the account has been properly set to expire, double-check yourself by using the chage command. 
The chage command is primarily used to view and change a user account's password aging information.
However, it also can access account expiration information.
The -l option allows you to list various information to which chage has access.
```
# chage -l tim | grep Account
Account expires                                   :  Jan  01,  2021
```
```
If you do not use the /etc/shadow file for storing your account passwords,
the chage utility doesn't work. In most cases,
 this is not a problem because the /etc/shadow file is configured to store password information by default on most Linux systems.
```




# Setting and changing passwords

When running as root, changing a user's password is possible by supplying that user's login name as a parameter of the passwd command, as in this example:
```
# passwd joe
Changing password for user joe.
New UNIX password: ********
Retype new UNIX password: ********
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
```

# Enforcing best password practices
Now you know what a good password looks like and how to change a password, 
but how do you enforce it on your Linux system? One place to start is with the PAM facility. With PAM,
you can define exact requirements that passwords must meet. For example, 
to ensure that passwords must be 12 characters long, with at least 2 numbers, 3 uppercase letters, and 2 lowercase letters, 
and are different than the previous passwords, you can add the following line to either the `/etc/pam.d/common-password` or `/etc/pam.d/common-auth` file:
```
password requisite pam_cracklib.so minlen=12, dcredit=2, ucredit=3, lcredit=2, difok=4 
```

Default values in the /etc/login.defs file for new accounts were covered in Chapter 11. Within the login.defs file are some settings affecting password aging and length:
```
PASS_MAX_DAYS     30
PASS_MIN_DAYS     5PASS_MIN_LEN      16PASS_WARN_AGE     7
```

For accounts that have already been created, you need to control password aging via the chage command. The options needed to control password aging with chage are listed in Table 22.2. Notice that there is not a password length setting in the chage utility.

|Option	|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|-M |	Sets the maximum number of days before a password needs to be changed. Equivalent to PASS_MAX_DAYS in /etc/login.defs.|
|-m	| Sets the minimum number of days before a password can be changed again. Equivalent to PASS_MIN_DAYS in /etc/login.defs.|
|-W	| Sets the number of days a user is warned before being forced to change the account password. Equivalent to PASS_WARN_AGE in /etc/login.defs.|

```
# chage -M 30 -I 5 tim
# chage -l tim | grep Password
Password expires                 : Mar 03, 2017
Password inactive                : Mar 08, 2017
```
tim's account will be locked 5 days after his password expires. 
This is helpful in situations where an employee has left the company but their user account has not yet been removed.
Depending upon your organization's security needs, consider setting all accounts to lock a certain number of days after passwords have expired.

# Managing dangerous filesystem permissions
Files with the SUID permission in the Owner category and execute permission in the Other category allow anyone to become the file's owner temporarily while the file is being executed in memory. The riskiest case is if the file's owner is root.

Similarly, files with the SGID permission in the Group category and execute permission in the Other category allow anyone temporarily to become a group member of the file's group while the file is being executed in memory. SGID can also be set on directories. This sets the group ID of any files created in the directory to the group ID of the directory.

Executable files with SUID or SGID are favorites of malicious users. Thus, it is best to use them sparingly. However, some files do need to keep these settings. Two examples are the passwd and the sudo commands that follow. Each of these files should maintain their SUID permissions.
```
$ ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 28804 Aug 17 20:50 /usr/bin/passwd
$ ls -l /usr/bin/sudo
---s--x--x. 2 root root 77364 Nov 3 08:10 /usr/bin/sudo
```

```
NOTE
The root user does not have write access to the /etc/shadow permissions, so how does root write to the /etc/shadow file? The root user is all-powerful and has complete access to all files, whether the permissions are listed or not.
```


# Monitoring log files

Understanding how message logging is done is critical to maintaining and troubleshooting a Linux system.
Before the systemd facility was used to gather messages in what is referred to as the systemd journal,
messages generated by the kernel and system services were directed to file in the /var/log directory.
While that is still true to a great extent with systemd, 
you can now also view log messages directly from the systemd journal using the journalctl command.

 #### Log Files in the /var/log Directory

|System Log Name|	Filename	|Description|

#### Viewing Log Files That Need Special Commands

|Filename|View Command|
|--------|------------|
|btmp	|dump-utmp btmp|
|dmesg|	dmesg|
|lastlog|	lastlog|
|wtmp	|dump-utmp wtmp|


To page through kernel messages, type the following command:
```
# journalctl -k

```
To view messages associated with a particular service, use the -u option followed by the service name to see log messages for any service, as in this example:
```
# journalctl -u NetworkManager.service
# journalctl -u httpd.service
# journalctl -u avahi-daemon.service
```

If you think that a security breach is in progress, you can watch all or selected messages as they come in by following messages. For example, to follow kernel messages or httpd messages as they come in, add the -f option (press Ctrl+C when you are finished):
```
# journalctl -k -f
# journalctl -f -u NetworkManager.service
```

To check just boot messages, you can list the boot IDs for all system boots and then boot the particular boot instance that interests you. The following examples display boot IDs and then shows boot messages for a selected boot ID:
```
# journalctl --list-boots
