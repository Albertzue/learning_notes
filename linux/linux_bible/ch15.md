Systemd: The latest versions of Fedora and RHEL use the systemd init system. 
It is the most complex of the init systems, but it also offers much more flexibility. 
Systemd offers not only features for starting and working with services,
but also lets you manage sockets, devices, mount points, swap areas, and other unit types.

Understanding the Initialization Daemon (init or systemd)
---

In order to understand service management, you need to understand the initialization daemon.
The initialization daemon can be thought of as the “mother of all processes.”
This daemon is the first process to be started by the kernel on the Linux server.
For Linux distributions that use SysVinit, the init daemon is literally named init.
For systemd, the init daemon is named systemd.

The Linux kernel has a process ID (PID) of 0. 
Thus, the initialization process (init or systemd) daemon has a parent process ID (PPID) of 0, and a PID of 1.
Once started, init is responsible for spawning (launching) processes configured to be started at the server's boot time,
such as the login shell (getty or mingetty process). 
It is also responsible for managing services.

 Running ps -e can immediately tell you if yours is a systemd system:
```
# ps -e | head
 PID TTY       TIME CMD
   1 ?      00:04:36 systemd
   2 ?      00:00:03 kthreadd
   3 ?      00:00:15 ksoftirqd/0
```
If PID 1 is the init daemon for your system

Learning systemd basics
---

Although the main job of systemd is to start and stop services, 
it can manage other types of things referred to as units. A unit is a group consisting of a name, 
type, and configuration file, and it is focused on a particular service or action. There are 12 systemd unit types:
```
automount
device
mount
path
service
snapshot
socket
target
timer
swap
slice
scope
```

The two primary systemd units with which you need to be concerned for dealing with services 
are service units and target units. 
A service unit is for managing daemons on your Linux server.
A target unit is simply a group of other units.

```
# systemctl list-unit-files --type=service
UNIT FILE                                  STATE
…
cups.service                               enabled
…
dbus.service                               static
…
NetworkManager.service                     enabled
…
poweroff.service                           static
…
sshd.service                               enabled
sssd.service                               disabled
…
276 unit files listed.
```
```
# systemctl list-unit-files --type=target
UNIT FILE                  STATE
anaconda.target            static
basic.target               static
bluetooth.target           static
cryptsetup.target          static
ctrl-alt-del.target        disabled
default.target             enabled
…
shutdown.target            static
sigpwr.target              static
smartcard.target           static
sockets.target             static
sound.target               static
swap.target                static
sysinit.target             static
syslog.target              static
time-sync.target           static
umount.target              static
43 unit files listed.
```

Notice that both of the configuration units’ file examples display units with a status of static, enabled, or disabled. 
The enabled status means that the unit is currently enabled. 
The disabled status means that the unit is currently disabled. The next status, static, 
is slightly confusing. It stands for “statically enabled,” 
and it means that the unit is enabled by default and cannot be disabled, even by root.


The service unit configuration files contain lots of information, such as what other services must be started, 
when this service can be started, which environmental file to use, and so on. 
The following example shows the sshd daemon's unit configuration file:
```
# cat /lib/systemd/system/sshd.service
[Unit]
Description=OpenSSH server daemon
Documentation=man:sshd(8) man:sshd_config(5)
After=network.target sshd-keygen.target
 
[Service]
Type=notify
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensshserver.config
EnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/sshd
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/sshd -D $OPTIONS $CRYPTO_POLICY
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
KillMode=process
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=42s
 
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
 
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

This basic service unit configuration file has the following options:

1. **Description:** A free-form description (comment line) of the service.
2. **Documentation:** Lists man pages for the sshd daemon and configuration file.
3. **After:** Configures ordering. In other words, it lists which units should be activated before this service is started.
4. **Environment File:** The service's configuration files.
5. **ExecStart:** The command used to start this service.
6. **ExecReload:** The command used to reload this service.
7. **WantedBy:** The target unit to which this service belongs.


You can view the various units that a target unit will activate by using the following command:
```
# systemctl show --property "Wants" multi-user.target
Wants=irqbalance.service firewalld.service plymouth-quit.service
systemd-update-utmp-runlevel.service systemd-ask-password-wall.path…
(END)
```

A target unit has both Wants and requirements, called Requires. A Wants means that all of the units listed are triggered to activate (start). If they fail or cannot be started, no problem—the target unit continues on its merry way. The preceding example is a display of Wants only.

A Requires is much more stringent than a Wants and potentially catastrophic. A Requires means that all of the units listed are triggered to activate (start). If they fail or cannot be started, the entire unit (group of units) is deactivated.

```
# cat /lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target
# This file is part of systemd.
#
…
 
[Unit]
Description=Multi-User
Documentation=man:systemd.special(7)
Requires=basic.target
Conflicts=rescue.service rescue.target
After=basic.target rescue.service rescue.target
AllowIsolate=yes
```

This basic target unit configuration file has the following options:

1. **Description:** This is just a free-form description of the target.
2. **Documentation:** Lists the appropriate systemd man page.
3. **Requires:** If this multi-user.target gets activated, the listed target unit is also activated. If the listed target unit is deactivated or fails, then multi-user.target is deactivated. If there are no After and Before options, then both multi-user.target and the listed target unit activate simultaneously.
4. **Conflicts:** This setting avoids conflicts in services. Starting multi-user.target stops the listed targets and services, and vice versa.
5. **After:** This setting configures ordering. In other words, it determines which units should be activated before starting this service.
7. **AllowIsolate:** This option is a Boolean setting of yes or no. If this option is set to yes, then this target unit, multi-user.target, is activated along with its dependencies and all others are deactivated.

If you need more help understanding the systemd daemon, 
you can enter **man -k systemd** at the command line to get a listing of the various systemd utilities’ documentation 
in the man pages.

Checking the Status of Services
---

To see all of the services that are being offered by a Linux server using systemd, use the following command:
```
# systemctl list-unit-files --type=service | grep -v disabled
UNIT FILE STATE
abrt-ccpp.service                          enabled
abrt-oops.service                          enabled
abrt-vmcore.service                        enabled
abrtd.service                              enabled
alsa-restore.service                       static
alsa-store.service                         static
...
```

To see if a particular service is running, use the following command:
```
# systemctl status cups.service
cups.service - CUPS Scheduler
  Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/cups.service; enabled)
  Active: active (running) since Wed 2019-09-18 17:32:27 EDT; 3 days ago
     Docs: man:cupsd(8)
  Main PID: 874 (cupsd)
    Status: "Scheduler is running…"
     Tasks: 1 (limit: 12232)
    Memory: 3.1M
    CGroup: /system.slice/cups.service
            └─874 /usr/sbin/cupsd -l
```

Stopping and Starting Services
---
```
# service cups status
cupsd (pid 5857) is running…
# service cups stop
Stopping cups:       [ OK ]
# service cups status
cupsd is stopped
```

To start a service, you simply use a `start` option instead of a `stop` option on the end of the service command, as follows:
```
# service cups start
Starting cups:       [ OK ]
# service cups status
cupsd (pid 6860) is running…
```

To restart a SysVinit service, the `restart` option is used. This option stops the service and then immediately starts it again:
```
# service cups restart
Stopping cups:      [ OK ]
Starting cups:      [ OK ]
# service cups status
cupsd (pid 7955) is running…
```

Reloading a service is different from restarting a service. When you reload a service, the service itself is not stopped. Only the service's configuration files are loaded again. The following example shows how to reload the cups daemon:
```
# service cups status
cupsd (pid 8236) is running…
# service cups reload
Reloading cups:     [ OK ]
# service cups status
cupsd (pid 8236) is running…
```

If a SysVinit service is stopped when you attempt to reload it, you get a FAILED status. This is shown in the following example:
```
# service cups status
cupsd is stopped
# service cups reload
Reloading cups:     [FAILED]
Stopping and starting systemd services
```
For the systemd daemon, the systemctl command works for stopping, starting, reloading, and restarting services. The options to the systemctl command should look familiar.
```
# systemctl status cups.service
cups.service - CUPS Printing Service
    Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/cups.service; enabled)
    Active: active (running) since Mon, 20 Apr 2020 12:36:3…
 Main PID: 1315 (cupsd)
    CGroup: name=systemd:/system/cups.service
           1315 /usr/sbin/cupsd -f
# systemctl stop cups.service
# systemctl status cups.service
cups.service - CUPS Printing Service
    Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/cups.service; enabled)
    Active: inactive (dead) since Tue, 21 Apr 2020 04:43:4…
    Process: 1315 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/cupsd -f
 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
    CGroup: name=systemd:/system/cups.service
```

Disabling a service with systemd
---
When the systemctl disable command is issued on dbus.service, it is simply ignored. Remember that static means that the service is enabled by default and cannot be disabled, even by root. Sometimes, disabling a service is not enough to make sure that it does not run. For example, you might want network.service to replace NetworkManager.service for starting network interfaces on your system. Disabling NetworkManager would keep the service from starting on its own. However, if some other service listed NetworkManager as a dependency, that service would try to start NetworkManager when it started.

To disable a service in a way that prevents it from ever running on your system, you can use the `mask` option. For example, to set the NetworkManager service so that it never runs, type the following:
```
# systemctl mask NetworkManager.service
ln -s '/dev/null' '/etc/systemd/system/NetworkManager.service'
```

The following systemctl example changes the server's persistent target unit from graphical.target to multi-user.target:
```
# systemctl get-default
graphical.target
#
 systemctl set-default runlevel3.target
 Removed /etc/systemd/system/default.target.
 Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/default.target → /usr/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.
# systemctl get-default
 multi-user.target
```
When the server is rebooted, the multi-user.target is the persistent target unit. Any services in the multi-user.target unit are started (activated) at that time.
```
Systemd targets are represented by target units. Target units end with the .target file extension and their only purpose is to group together other systemd units through a chain of dependencies. For example, the graphical.target unit, which is used to start a graphical session, starts system services such as the GNOME Display Manager (gdm.service) or Accounts Service (accounts-daemon.service) and also activates the multi-user.target unit. Similarly, the multi-user.target unit starts other essential system services such as NetworkManager (NetworkManager.service) or D-Bus (dbus.service) and activates another target unit named basic.target.
```

|Runlevel	|Description|
|--------|-------------|
|0|	System halt i.e., the system can be safely powered off with no activity.|
|1|	Single user mode.|
|2|	Multiple user mode with no NFS (network file system).|
|3|	Multiple user modes under the command line interface and not under the graphical user interface.|
|4|	User-definable.|
|5|	Multiple user mode under GUI (graphical user interface) and this is the standard runlevel for most of the LINUX-based systems.|
6	Reboot which is used to restart the system.

Adding new services to SysVinit
---

When adding a new or customized service to a Linux SysVinit server, you must complete three steps in order to have the service managed by SysVinit:

1. Create a new or customized service script file.
2. Move the new or customized service script to the proper location for SysVinit management.
3. Set appropriate permission on the script.
4. Add the service to a specific runlevel.

Adding new services to systemd
---
When adding a new or customized service to a Linux systemd server, you have to complete three steps in order to have the service managed by systemd:

1. Create a new or customized service configuration unit file for the new or customized service.
2. Move the new or customized service configuration unit file to the proper location for systemd management.
3. Add the service to a specific target unit's Wants to have the new or customized service start automatically with other services.

#### Step 1: Create a new or customized service configuration unit file
If you are customizing a service configuration unit file, simply make a copy of the original unit file from `/lib/systemd/system` and add any desired customizations.

At bare minimum, you need Description and ExecStart options for a service unit configuration file:
```bash
# cat My_New_Service.service
[Unit]
Description=My New Service
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/My_New_Service
```
At the command line, type `man systemd.service` to find out more about the various service unit file options.

#### Step 2: Move the service configuration unit file
You can place your system service configuration unit file in one of the following two locations:
```
/etc/systemd/system
```
- This location is used to store customized local service configuration unit files.
- Files in this location are not overwritten by software installations or upgrades. Files here are used by the system even if there is a file of the same name in the /lib/systemd/system directory.
```
/lib/systemd/system
```
- This location is used to store system service configuration unit files.
- Files in this location are overwritten by software installations and upgrades.

Files here are used by the system only if there is no file of the same name in the /etc/systemd/system directory.\
Thus, the best place to store your new or customized service configuration unit file is in /etc/systemd/system.
```
TIP
When you create a new or customized service, in order for the change to take effect without a server reboot, you need to issue a special command. At the command line, type systemctl daemon-reload.
```

#### Step 3: Add the service to the Wants directory

This final step is optional. It needs to be done only if you want your new service to start with a particular systemd target unit. For a service to be activated (started) by a particular target unit, it must be in that target unit's Wants directory.

First, add the line WantedBy=desired.target to the bottom of your service configuration unit file. The following example shows that the desired target unit for this new service is multi-user.target:
```
# cat /etc/systemd/system/My_New_Service.service
[Unit]
Description=My New Fake Service
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/My_New_Service
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
To add a new service unit to a target unit, you need to create a symbolic link. The following example shows the files located in the multi-user.target unit's Wants directory. Previously, in the section “Understanding systemd initialization,” the systemctl command was used to list Wants, and it is still the preferred method. Notice that in this directory, the files are symbolic links pointing to service unit configuration files in the /lib/systemd/system directory.
```
# ls /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants
abrt-ccpp.service     cups.path           remote-fs.target
abrtd.service         fcoe.service        rsyslog.service
abrt-oops.service     irqbalance.service  sendmail.service
abrt-vmcore.service   lldpad.service      sm-client.service
atd.service           mcelog.service      sshd-keygen.service
auditd.service        mdmonitor.service   sshd.service
…
# ls -l /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants
total 0

…
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 32 Apr 26 20:05 sshd.service ->
    /lib/systemd/system/sshd.service
```
