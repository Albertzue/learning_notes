Adding users with useradd
---
```
# useradd -g users -G wheel,apache -s /bin/tcsh -c "Sara Green" sara
```
In this case, useradd is told to make users the primary group sara belongs to (-g), 
add her to the wheel and apache groups, and assign tcsh as her primary command shell (-s). 
A home directory in /home under the user's name (/home/sara) is created by default. 

Setting user defaults
---

The useradd command determines the default values for new accounts by reading the /etc/login.defs and /etc/default/useradd files.
You can modify those defaults by editing the files manually with a standard text editor. 
the following is an example containing many of the settings that you might find in a login.defs file:
```
PASS_MAX_DAYS      99999
PASS_MIN_DAYS      0
PASS_MIN_LEN       5
PASS_WARN_AGE      7
UID_MIN                  1000
UID_MAX                 60000
SYS_UID_MIN               200
SYS_UID_MAX               999
GID_MIN                  1000
GID_MAX                 60000
SYS_GID_MIN               201
SYS_GID_MAX               999
CREATE_HOME yes
```

If you want to view other default settings, find them in the /etc/default/useradd file. You can also see default settings by typing the useradd command with the -D option, as follows:
```
# useradd -D
GROUP=100
HOME=/home
INACTIVE=-1
EXPIRE=
SHELL=/bin/bash
SKEL=/etc/skel
CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=yes
```

Not all useradd options can be used in conjunction with the -D option. You can use only the five options listed here.
```
-b default_home: Set the default directory in which user home directories are created. Replace default_home with the directory name to use (for example, -b /garage). Usually, this is /home.
-e default_expire_date: Set the default expiration date on which the user account is disabled. The default_expire_date value should be replaced with a date in the form YYYY-MM-DD (for example, -e 2011-10-17).
-f default_inactive: Set the number of days after a password has expired before the account is disabled. Replace default_inactive with a number representing the number of days (for example, -f 7).
-g default_group: Set the default group in which new users will be placed. Normally, useradd creates a new group with the same name and ID number as the user. Replace default_group with the group name to use (for example, -g bears).
-s default_shell: Set the default shell for new users. This is /bin/bash, typically. Replace default_shell with the full path to the shell that you want as the default for new users (for example, -s /bin/ash).
```

Deleting users with userdel
---
```
# userdel -r chris
```
Here, the user chris is removed from the /etc/password file. The â€“r option removes the user's home directory as well.


Before you delete the user, you may want to run a find command to find all files that would be left behind by the user. After you delete the user, you could search on user ID to find files left behind. Here are two find commands to do those things:
```
# find / -user chris -ls
# find / -uid 504 -ls
```

Because files that are not assigned to any username are considered to be a security risk, 
it is a good idea to find those files and assign them to a real user account. Here's an example of a find command that finds all files in the filesystem that are not associated with any user (the files are listed by UID):
```
# find / -nouser -ls
```

Let's turn to the sara user and group accounts for examples. Here are a few facts about using groups:

When sara creates a file or directory, by default, that file or directory is assigned to sara's primary group (also called sara).
The user sara can belong to zero or more supplementary groups. If sara were a member of groups named sales and marketing, those entries could look like the following in the /etc/group file:
```
sales:x:1302:joe,bill,sally,sara
marketing:x:1303:mike,terry,sara
```
The user sara can't add herself to a supplementary group. She can't even add another user to her sara group. Only someone with root privilege can assign users to groups.
Any file assigned to the sales or marketing group is accessible to sara with group and other permissions (whichever provides the most access). If sara wants to create a file with the sales or marketing groups assigned to it, she could use the newgrp command. In this example, sara uses the newgrp command to have sales become her primary group temporarily and creates a file:
```
[sara]$ touch file1
[sara]$ newgrp sales
[sara]$ touch file2
[sara]$ ls -l file*
-rw-rw-r--. 1 sara sara 0 Jan 18 22:22 file1
-rw-rw-r--. 1 sara sales 0 Jan 18 22:23 file2
[sara]$ exit
```
```
# groupadd kings
# groupadd -g 1325 jokers
```
In the examples just shown, the group named kings is created with the next available group ID. 
After that, the group jokers is created using the 1325 group ID. 
```
# groupmod -g 330 jokers
# groupmod -n jacks jokers
```
In the first example, the group ID for jokers is changed to 330. In the second, the name jokers is changed to jacks.

Setting permissions with Access Control Lists
---

Here are a few things to know about ACLs:

1. For ACLs to be used, they must be enabled on a filesystem when that filesystem is mounted.
2. In Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, ACLs are automatically enabled on any filesystem created when the system is installed.
3. If you create a filesystem after installation (such as when you add a hard disk), you need to make sure that the acl mount option is used when the filesystem is mounted (more on that later).
4. To add ACLs to a file, you use the setfacl command; to view ACLs set on a file, you use the getfacl command.
5. To set ACLs on any file or directory, you must be the actual owner (user) assigned to it. In other words, being assigned user or group permissions with setfacl does not give you permission to change ACLs on those files yourself.
6. Because multiple users and groups can be assigned to a file/directory, the actual permission a user has is based on a union of all user/group designations to which they belong. For example, if a file had read-only permission (r--) for the sales group and read/write/execute (rwx) for the market group, and mary belonged to both, mary would have rwx permission.

Using the setfacl command, you can modify permissions (-m) or remove ACL permissions (-x). The following is an example of the syntax of the setfacl command:
```
setfacl -m u:username:rwx filename


[mary]$ touch /tmp/memo.txt
[mary]$ ls -l /tmp/memo.txt
-rw-rw-r--. 1 mary mary 0 Jan 21 09:27 /tmp/memo.txt
[mary]$ setfacl -m u:bill:rw /tmp/memo.txt
[mary]$ setfacl -m g:sales:rw /tmp/memo.txt
```

```
[mary]$ ls -l /tmp/memo.txt
-rw-rw-r--+ 1 mary mary 0 Jan 21 09:27 /tmp/memo.txt
[mary]$ getfacl /tmp/memo.txt
# file: tmp/memo.txt
# owner: mary
# group: mary
user::rw-
user:bill:rw-
group::rw-
group:sales:rw-
mask::rw-
other::r--
```
From the ls -l output, 
notice the plus sign (+) in the rw-rw-r--+ output. The plus sign indicates that ACLs are set on the file, 
so you know to run the getfacl command to see how ACLs are set.
The output shows mary as owner and group (same as what you see with ls -l), the regular user permissions (rw-), 
and permissions for ACL user bill (rw-).
The same is true for group permissions and permissions for the group sales. Other permissions are r--.
The mask line (near the end of the previous getfacl example) requires some special discussion. 
As soon as you set ACLs on a file, the regular group permission on the file sets a mask of the maximum permission an ACL user or group can have on a file. 
So, even if you provide an individual with more ACL permissions than the group permissions allow, 
the individual's effective permissions do not exceed the group permissions as in the following example:
```
[mary]$ chmod 644 /tmp/memo.txt
[mary]$ getfacl /tmp/memo.txt
# file: tmp/memo.txt
# owner: mary
# group: mary
user::rw-
user:bill:rw-   #effective:r--
group::rw-      #effective:r--
group:sales:rw- #effective:r--
mask::r--
other::r--
```

Notice in the preceding example that even though the user bill and group sales have rw- permissions,
their effective permissions are r--. So, 
bill or anyone in sales would not be able to change the file unless mary were to open permissions again (for example, by typing chmod 664 /tmp/memo.txt).

Setting default ACLs
---

Setting default ACLs on a directory enables your ACLs to be inherited. This means that when new files and directories are created in that directory, they are assigned the same ACLs. To set a user or group ACL permission as the default, you add a d: to the user or group designation. Consider the following example:
```
[mary]$ mkdir /tmp/mary
[mary]$ setfacl -m d:g:market:rwx /tmp/mary/
[mary]$ getfacl /tmp/mary/
# file: tmp/mary/
# owner: mary
# group: mary
user::rwx
group::rwx
other::r-x
default:user::rwx
default:group::rwx
default:group:sales:rwx
default:group:market:rwx
default:mask::rwx
default:other::r-x
 ```

Notice that when you create a file in that directory, the inherited permissions are different. Because a regular file is created without execute permission, the effective permission is reduced to rw-:
```
[mary@cnegus ~]$ touch /tmp/mary/file.txt
[mary@cnegus ~]$ getfacl /tmp/mary/file.txt
# file: tmp/mary/file.txt
# owner: mary
# group: mary
user::rw-
group::rwx        #effective:rw-
group:sales:rwx   #effective:rw-
group:market:rwx  #effective:rw-
mask::rw-
other::r--
```

Enabling ACLs
---

A second way to add acl support to a filesystem is to add the acl option to the line in the /etc/fstab file that automatically mounts the filesystem at boot time. The following is an example of what a line would look like that mounts the ext4 filesystem located on the /dev/sdc1 device to the /var/stuff directory:
```
/dev/sdc1    /var/stuff    ext4   acl         1  2
```

A third way that you can add ACL support to a filesystem is to mount the filesystem by hand and specifically request the acl mount option. So, if there were no entry for the filesystem in the /etc/fstab file, after creating the mount point (/var/stuff), type the following command to mount the filesystem and include ACL support:
```
# mount -o acl /dev/sdc1 /var/stuff
```

Adding directories for users to collaborate

Creating group collaboration directories (set GID bit)
---

Commands with the set UID or set GID bits set are different. It is the owner and group assigned to the command, respectively, that determines the permissions the command has to access resources on the computer. So, a set UID command owned by root would run with root permissions; a set GID command owned by apache would have apache group permissions.

```
setuid: a bit that makes an executable run with the privileges of the owner of the file

setgid: a bit that makes an executable run with the privileges of the group of the file
```

Creating restricted deletion directories (sticky bit)
---
```
sticky bit: a bit set on directories that allows only the owner or root can delete files and subdirectories
```

Centralizing User Accounts
---

Authentication domains that are supported via the authconfig command include LDAP, NIS, and Windows Active Directory.

Supported centralized database types include the following:
```
LDAP The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a popular protocol for providing directory services (such as phone books,
 addresses, and user accounts). It is an open standard that is configured in many types of computing environments.
```
```
NIS The Network Information Service (NIS) was originally created by Sun Microsystems to propagate information such as user accounts,
host configuration, and other types of system information across many UNIX systems. Because NIS passes information in clear text,
 most enterprises now use the more secure LDAP or Winbind protocols for centralized authentication.
```
```
Winbind Selecting Winbind from the Authentication Configuration window enables you to authenticate your users against a Microsoft Active Directory (AD) server.
 Many large companies extend their desktop authentication setup to do server configuration as well as using an AD server.
```
