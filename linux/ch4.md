```
$ cd ~
$ pwd
/home/chris
$ cd ~/Music
$ pwd
/home/chris/Music
$ cd ../../../usr
$ pwd
/usr
```
The tilde (~) represents your home directory. So cd ~ takes you there. You can use the tilde to refer to directories relative to your home directory as well, such as /home/chris/Music with ~/Music. Typing a name as an option takes you to a directory below the current directory, but you can use two dots (..) to go to a directory above the current directory. The example shown takes you up three directory levels (to /), and then takes you into the /usr directory
