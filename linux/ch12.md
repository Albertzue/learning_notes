Understanding Disk Storage
---

For Linux, at least one disk partition is required, assigned to the root (/) of the entire Linux filesystem.
However, it is more common to have separate partitions that are assigned to particular directories,such as /home, /var, and/or /tmp. 
Each of the partitions is connected to the larger Linux filesystem by mounting it to a point in the filesystem where you want that partition to be used. 
Any file added to the mount point directory of a partition, or a subdirectory, is stored on that partition.
