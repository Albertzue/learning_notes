# Implementing Linux Security with Cryptography
To understand cryptographic concepts and the various Linux tools, you should know a few cryptography terms:

- Plain text: Text that a human or machine can read and comprehend
- Ciphertext: Text that a human or machine cannot read and comprehend
- Encryption: The process of converting plain text into ciphertext using an algorithm
- Decryption: The process of converting cipher text into plain text using an algorithm
- Cipher: The algorithm used to encrypt plain text into ciphertext and decrypt ciphertext into plain text
- Block cipher: A cipher that breaks data into blocks before encrypting
- Stream cipher: A cipher that encrypts the data without breaking it up
- Key: A piece of data required by the cipher to encrypt or decrypt data successfully

#### Understanding hashing

Hashing is not encryption, but it is a form of cryptography. Remember from Chapter 22, “Understanding Basic Linux Security,” that hashing is a one-way mathematical process used to create ciphertext.
However, unlike encryption, after you create a hash, you cannot de-hash it back to its original plain text.

In order for a hashing algorithm to be used in computer security, it needs to be collision-free, which means that the hashing algorithm does not output the same hash for two totally different inputs.
Each input must have a unique hashed output. Thus, cryptographic hashing is a one-way mathematical process that is collision-free.

By default, cryptography is already in use on a Linux system. For example, the /etc/shadow file contains hashed passwords. Hashing is used on Linux systems for the following:

- Passwords (Chapter 22)
- Verifying files
- Digital signatures
- Virus signatures (Chapter 22)

A hash is also called a message digest, checksum, fingerprint, or signature. One Linux utility that produces message digests is the sha256sum utility.

To create your hash, run the sha256sum command on the ISO image after you download that image. The sha256sum hash results for the downloaded software file are shown in the code that follows:
```
$ sha256sum Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-30-1.2.iso
a4e2c49368860887f1cc1166b0613232d4d5de6b46f29c9756bc7cfd5e13f39f
   Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-30-1.2.iso
```
#### Understanding encryption/decryption
The primary use of cryptography on a Linux system is to encode data to hide it (encryption) from unauthorized eyes and then decode the data (decryption) for authorized eyes. On a Linux system, you can encrypt the following:
- Individual files
- Partitions and volumes
- Web page connections
- Network connections
- Backups
- Zip files

#### Symmetric key cryptography
Symmetric cryptography, also called secret key or private key cryptography, encrypts plain text using a single keyed cipher. The same key is needed in order to decrypt the data. The advantage of symmetric key cryptography is speed. The disadvantage is the need to share the single key if the encrypted data is to be decrypted by another person.
#### Asymmetric key cryptography
Asymmetric cryptography, also called private/public key cryptography, uses two keys, called a key pair. A key pair consists of a public key and a private key. The public key is just that—public. There is no need to keep it secret. The private key needs to be kept secret.

#### Understanding digital signatures
A digital signature is an electronic originator used for authentication and data verification. A digital signature is not a scan of your physical signature. Instead, it is a cryptographic token sent with a file, so the file's receiver can be assured that the file came from you and has not been modified in any way.

# Implementing Linux Security with PAM

Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) was invented by Sun Microsystems and originally implemented in the Solaris operating system. The Linux-PAM project began in 1997. Today, most Linux distributions use PAM.

PAM simplifies the authentication management process. Remember that authentication (see Chapter 22, “Understanding Basic Linux Security”) is the process of determining that a subject (aka user or process) is who they say they are. This process is sometimes called “identification and authentication.” PAM is a centralized method of providing authentication for the Linux system and applications.

#### Understanding the PAM authentication process

When a subject (user or process) requests access to a PAM-aware application or utility, two primary components are used to complete the subject authentication process:

- The PAM-aware application's configuration file
- The PAM modules the configuration file uses

Linux comes with many applications that are PAM-aware, with their needed configuration files and PAM modules already installed. If you have any special authentication needs, you can most likely find a PAM module that has already been written for that need. However, before you start tweaking PAM, you need to understand more about how PAM operates.

1. A subject (user or process) requests access to an application.
2. The application's PAM configuration file, which contains an access policy, is open and read.
   The access policy is set via a list of all the PAM modules to be used in the authentication process. This PAM module(s) list is called a stack.

3. The PAM modules in the stack are invoked in the order in which they are listed.
4. Each PAM module returns either a success or failure status.
5. The stack continues to be read in order, and it is not necessarily stopped by a single returned failure status.
6. The status results of all of the PAM modules are combined into a single overall result of authentication success or failure.

Typically, if a single PAM module returns a failure status, access to the application is denied. However, this is dependent upon the configuration file settings. Most PAM configuration files are located in /etc/pam.d. The general format of a PAM configuration file is
```
context   control flag   PAM module [module options]
```

#### Understanding PAM contexts

PAM modules have standard functions that provide different authentication services. These standard functions within a PAM module can be divided into function types called contexts. Contexts can also be called module interfaces or types. In Table 23.3, the different PAM contexts are listed along with what type of authentication service they provide.

|Context|Service Description|
|-------|-------------------|
|auth|	Provides authentication management services, such as verifying account passwords|
|account|	Provides account validation services, such as time-of-day access restrictions|
|password|	Manages account passwords, such as password length restrictions|

#### Understanding PAM control flags
In a PAM configuration file, control flags are used to determine the overall status, which are returned to the application. A control flag is either of the following:

- Simple keyword: The only concern here is if the corresponding PAM module returns a response of either “failed” or “success.” See Table 23.4 for how these statuses are handled.[table23.4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/linux-bible-10th/9781119578888/c23.xhtml#R_c23-tbl-0004)

#### Understanding PAM modules
A PAM module is actually a suite of shared library modules (DLL files) stored in /usr/lib64/security (64-bit). You can see a list of the various installed PAM modules on your system by entering ls /usr/lib64/security/pam*.so at the command line.
```
NOTE
On Ubuntu, to find your PAM modules, type the command sudo find / -name pam*.so at the command line.
```

```
Many of the PAM configuration files have a man page associated with them. For example, to find out more information on the pam_unix module, type man pam_unix at the command line of your Fedora and RHEL distribution. There are also module documentation files in the /usr/share/doc/pam-*/txts/ directory.
```
