The files can be executables (commands), configuration files, documentation, and other software items. The metadata includes such things as dependencies, licensing, package sizes, descriptions, and other information. Multiple command-line and graphical tools are available for working with DEB files in Ubuntu, Debian,
and other Linux distributions.

sudo apt-get update           Get the latest package versions

    $ sudo apt-cache show vsftpd    Display information about a package
    $ sudo apt-get install vsftpd   Install the vsftpd package
    $ sudo apt-get upgrade          Update installed packages if upgrade ready
    $ sudo apt-cache pkgnames       List all packages that are installed
