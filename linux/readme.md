$ ls

$ ls --hide=Desktop
Documents Music Public Videos

In the previous example, the --hide option tells the ls command not to display the file or directory named Desktop when listing the contents of the directory.\
Notice that the equal sign immediately follows the option (no space) and then the argument (again, no space).

The results show a common default path for a regular Linux user. Directories in the path list are separated by colons. Most user commands that come with Linux are stored in the /bin, /usr/bin, or /usr/local/bin directory. The /sbin and /usr/sbin directories contain administrative commands (some Linux systems don't put those directories in regular users' paths). The last directory shown is the bin directory in the user's home directory (/home/chris/bin).

Built-in command. This is a command built into the shell. As a result, there is no representation of the command in the filesystem. Some of the most common commands that you will use are shell built-in commands, such as cd (to change directories), echo (to output text to the screen), exit (to exit from a shell), fg (to bring a command running in the background to the foreground), history (to see a list of commands that were previously run), pwd (to list the present working directory), set (to set shell options), and type (to show the location of a command).
