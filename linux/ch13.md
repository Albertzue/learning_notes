Using configuration files
---

Traditionally, Linux servers have been configured by editing plain-text files in the /etc directory (or subdirectories). Often, there is a primary configuration file; 
sometimes, there is a related configuration directory in which files ending in .conf can be pulled into the main configuration file.

The httpd package (Apache web server) is an example of a server package that has a primary configuration file and a directory where other configuration files can be dropped in and be included with the service. 
The main configuration file in Fedora and RHEL is /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf. The configuration directory is /etc/httpd/conf.d/.
```
instead of using vi to edit configuration files, use vim. Using the vim command can help you catch configuration file errors as you are editing.

The vim command knows about the formats of many configuration files (passwd, httpd.conf, fstab, and others).
 If you make a mistake and type an invalid term or option in one of those files, or break the format somehow, the color of the text changes. For example, in /etc/fstab,
if you change the option defaults to default, the word's color changes.
```

You can also use the Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) facility to adjust the number of times that someone can have failed login attempts before blocking access to that person. 
PAM also includes other features for locking down authentication to your Linux server.
